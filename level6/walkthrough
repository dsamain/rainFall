We can see that this exec segfault if we just execute it, but if we give an arg it prints "Nope"
also from the .rodata it seems to call cat on level7 pass, so that's our goal (it calls system in function n)

from our guesses:
function m prints "Nope"
function n gives the flag

It seems to use pointer to function because none is called directly from main, but we can see 'call eax' right before return
So we need to find a way to put n pointer inside eax instead of m pointer

We can see that the main puts 0x8048468 (address of m) inside edx

By disassembling the main it does

m1 = malloc(64) => 0x804a008
m2 = malloc(4)  => 0x804a050

So the 2 mallocs are next to each other: [ 64 malloc ] [ metadata (8 bytes) ] [ 4 malloc ]
which is normal

After the 1st one the address is pushed on 7th position on stack (so 6 random values then the ptr)
After the 2nd one the address is pushed on top of the previous address (so in the stack we have [some values] [2nd malloc (4)] [1st malloc(64)] )

Then *m2 = m (address of m is copied into first 4 bytes of m2)
So as we guessed the 2nd malloc of 4 is only here to contain the address of m

Then argv[1] is loaded into eax (ebp + 0xc)
and eax is copied to edx

our guess is strcpy(m1, argv[1])

So we can overflow m1 (since it's before m2) into m2, and thus change the address contained in m2
So we need to write 64 (malloc) + 8 (m2 metadata) to reach the address, then we can just print n address

n address: 0x08048454 ("\x54\x85\x04\x08")

"A"*72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"

final cmd:
./level6 $(python -c 'print "A"*72 + "\x54\x84\x04\x08"')
