The binary open a prompt and seem to do something with the input auth, service and login
I was entering random combination of those words in the terminal and a shell just opened ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

After analyzing the code, we see that auth increment the global var auth by 0x10, the command service increment the global var service by 0x10
when doing login, it checks the memory at auth+32, then if not null it execs
so we can just call:
auth (init auth variable)
service (increment by 16)
service (incrment by 16 so 32 total)
login => we have a shell gg
