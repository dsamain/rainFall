the script 'exploit.py' work while executed in gdb 
(with 'env - gdb /home/user/level2/level2' and then 'unset env LINES COLUMNS')
Sometimes the stack is different in gdb because of the main arguments and because of the env
that why we should execute with env - and with the absolute path to the exec 
(because argv[0] would be different between 'gdb level2' and './level2')

but even with that it don't work outside of gdb for some reason :)
