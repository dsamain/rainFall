the binary read from stdin (with fgets so no buffer overflow possible) and than call printf with the input as the format.
Then it set if specific adress contain the value 0x40,

If we put some %. is the format string, it will search for the parameter in the stack.
The %n format take an address and write at it location the number of char output by printf
So we just have to write 0x40 char before the %n and ensure that we have the target address at the right place in the buffer.

see exploit.py to generate the input
